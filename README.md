# Section_03 Battle Tanks

My work on Section 4 of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy.
See [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount) for a special GitHub offer on the course.

In this UE4 project, you battle other tanks and turrets on a large 3d terrain. The tanks have physics based wheel and axle movement.
